The Undergraduate Research Monitoring Committee (UGRMC) is the primary body responsible for reviewing research protocols submitted by Undergraduate Principal Investigators (PIs). 
<Flowchart arrow>
Upon evaluation, UGRMC issues a certificate of approval, which serves as an authorization to conduct the proposed research.
(Categorise to 3 opportunities: GJ-STRAUS, ICMR/Other Grants, Independent)
GJ-STRAUS

Flow chart:
Selection of Project for GJ STRAUS -> Release of UGRMC Guidelines->All the students have to present their proposal on a PPT
